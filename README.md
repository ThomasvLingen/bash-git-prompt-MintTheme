# bash-git-prompt-MintTheme
Small theme I made for [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) so it would fit in with Linux Mint
### How to use it
Clone this repo and stuff "Single_line_Mint.bgptheme" into your [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) themes folder(located by default in ~/.bash-git.prompt/themes)

Go into your.bashrc and set the [bash-git-prompt](https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt) theme to "Single_line_Mint"(GIT_PROMPT_THEME=Single_line_Mint)
